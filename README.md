# Skills Library

A collection of reusable AI agent skills for marketing, content creation, and web development.

## What are skills?

Skills are structured instructions that give AI agents (Claude, GPT, etc.) domain expertise and systematic workflows. Instead of prompting from scratch, you load a skill and get consistent, high-quality output.

## Available Skills

### [recursive-improvement](./recursive-improvement/SKILL.md)
A pattern for generating higher-quality output by iterating against explicit scoring criteria. Generate → Evaluate → Diagnose → Improve → Repeat until it passes.

**Use for:** Headlines, CTAs, landing page copy, social content, ad copy — anything where quality matters.

---

## How to Use

1. Copy the skill's `SKILL.md` into your AI's context
2. Reference it in your system prompt or project instructions
3. The AI will follow the workflow and criteria defined in the skill

Works with Claude (via Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), ChatGPT, and other LLM-based tools.
